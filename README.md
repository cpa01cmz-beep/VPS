# Free VPS Research

This repository automatically researches and updates a list of free VPS offers using Google Gemini.

## How It Works

1. A GitHub Actions workflow runs weekly to search for free VPS offers.
2. The search results are written to [`free-vps.md`](free-vps.md).
3. The file is automatically committed and pushed if there are changes.
